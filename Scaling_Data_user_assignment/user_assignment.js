a) Now lets learn about scaling the data. 1) write a function that generates the sequence of number from 0 to 9.  2) make changes to the function to display the number range from 0 to 10. 3) create linear scale of number 0 to 9. 
b)Now lets work on linear scale a more in depth. 1) add linear scale to our code. 2) calculate horizontal and vertical positions of visuals3) calculate size of the bubbles using a scale. 
C)use ordinal scale and categorical color scheme to colors to bubbles."
